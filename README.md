# Discord-pyBot
A Discord Bot made with Python

## About:
The goal is to create a super bot with many structures, enabling users to choose between these structures and develop their own discord bot.

## Structures:
### The structures were created using several libraries available for Python, APIs, and code snippets developed by others. All structures are commented with the title and library used.

Structures List:
- Help (Type !help)
- Math (No need to type a specific term, the bot recognizes a mathematical expression (e.g. 2 + 15/5)
- Random Choice (Type !draw + Terms used for the draw (e.g. !draw matheus, Lucas, Marie) )
- Weather (Type !weather + city (e.g !weather New York) )
- Youtube Count (Type !yt + youtube username (e.g. !yt pewdiepie) )
- More soon

# For Future
A Bot Builder App to generate bots easily.

# Attention!
If you have chosen a structure that uses a library, You must download it and import it into your project.
